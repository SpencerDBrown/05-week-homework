This weeks homework was to construct a dayily planner/scheduler. With the ability to tell the current hour of the work day as well as emphasize the hours that have passed and the ones to come. A reactive planner that will take whatever is written in the text field, and is saved to local storage when the save button is hit. This one took me a few tries throughout the week, I ended up re-writing it all yesterday because I realized I made it so incredibly hard for myself with my initial attempt. After taking an hour and writing a distinct outline of the tasks required of the READ.me I was able to tackle each objective thouroughly. The end result looks much prettier than the road getting here, there were a lot of errors initially (pretty much all of them being user error and just minor syntax mistakes). 

After taking the time to slow down and reorganize myself (and quite a bit of research online) I was able to appproach each task individually and redesign everything from the ground up. All together this homework was harder for me, but not because it was too challenging but because I have a habit of creating problems for myself without realizing them till later on. For instance, I had a few areas where I defined a variable as "const" instead of "let" and didn't realize why it wasn't functioning correctly when I was changing the value/paramerter of said variable, its the small things. Im proud of the end result!
